<b>Cognifyz Technologies Data Analyst Internship</b>

Welcome to My Data Analysis Internship Journey! 

During my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I completed a series of exciting and challenging data analysis tasks designed to enhance my analytical skills and practical knowledge in data science. This README outlines the tasks I have worked on, the tools I used, and the key insights gained throughout the program.

<b>Tasks Completed:

Level 1: Basic Data Analysis</b>

<b>Top Cuisines Analysis:</b>


Identified the top three most common cuisines in the dataset.

Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each of the top cuisines.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas), Excel

Outcome: Insights into popular cuisines and market trends.

<b>City Analysis:</b>

Determined the city with the highest number of restaurants.

Calculated the average rating for restaurants in each city and identified the city with the highest average rating.

Tools Used: Python, Excel

Outcome: Data-driven understanding of regional market performance.

<b>Price Range Distribution:</b>

Created histograms and bar charts to visualize the distribution of restaurant price ranges.

Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

Tools Used: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Outcome: Clear visualization of price range trends among restaurants.

<b>Online Delivery Analysis:</b>

Determined the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.

Compared the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery services.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Outcome: Insights into customer preferences related to delivery options.

<b>Level 2: Advanced Data Analysis</b>

<b>Restaurant Ratings Analysis:</b>

Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings and determined the most common rating range.

Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

Tools Used: Python (NumPy, Pandas)

Outcome: Understanding of rating trends and customer feedback patterns.

<b>Cuisine Combination Analysis:</b>

Identified the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset.

Analyzed whether certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas)

Outcome: Insights into popular cuisine pairings and customer preferences.

<b>Geographic Analysis:</b>

Plotted the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude.

Identified patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

Tools Used: Python (Folium, Geopandas)

Outcome: Geographic insights into restaurant distribution and potential market opportunities.

<b>Restaurant Chain Analysis:</b>

Identified any restaurant chains present in the dataset.

Analyzed the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas)

Outcome: Evaluation of brand performance and customer loyalty trends.

<b>Level 3: Specialized Data Insights</b>

<b>Restaurant Reviews Analysis:</b>


Analyzed text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords.

Explored the relationship between review length and rating.

Tools Used: Python (NLTK, TextBlob)

Outcome: Deeper understanding of customer sentiment and review impact.

<b>Votes Analysis:</b>

Identified restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes.

Analyzed the correlation between the number of votes and restaurant ratings.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn)

Outcome: Insights into customer engagement and rating dynamics.

<b>Price Range vs. Services Analysis:</b>

Explored the relationship between price range, online delivery, and table booking availability.

Determined if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Outcome: Analysis of service offerings relative to price points.

<b>Key Learnings:</b
									 >
Advanced data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure data quality.

Effective use of Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.

Practical experience in identifying patterns, trends, and insights to drive data-driven decision-making.

Enhanced ability to communicate findings through clear and compelling visualizations.
